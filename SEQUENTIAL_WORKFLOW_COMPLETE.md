# 🎉 Sequential Workflow Implementation - COMPLETE

## ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Your RCA Agent dashboard now has a fully functional sequential workflow system exactly as requested!

## 🔧 **What Was Implemented**

### **Sequential Button Management**
- ✅ **Only Triage is clickable initially** - All other buttons are disabled
- ✅ **Step-by-step progression** - Each button only becomes available after the previous step completes
- ✅ **Visual completion indicators** - Completed steps show green background with checkmark (✓)
- ✅ **Disabled state styling** - Unavailable buttons are grayed out and unclickable

### **Workflow State Tracking**
- ✅ **Global workflow state** - Tracks completion status of each step
- ✅ **Incident-specific workflow** - Each incident has its own workflow state
- ✅ **Automatic reset** - Switching incidents resets the workflow to start from Triage

### **Completion Notifications**
- ✅ **Workflow status panel** - Shows current step progress and next available action
- ✅ **Step completion messages** - Clear notifications when each step finishes
- ✅ **Progress indicators** - Real-time updates on workflow status

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- ✅ **Realistic timing** - Each step takes appropriate time (2-3 seconds) to simulate real processing
- ✅ **Button state management** - All buttons disabled during processing to prevent conflicts
- ✅ **Clear messaging** - Users know exactly what's happening and what to do next
- ✅ **Duplicate prevention** - Can't run the same step twice on the same incident
