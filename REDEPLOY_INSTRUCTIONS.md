# Redeploy Instructions - Environment Variable Added ✅

## 🎉 **Great Progress!**

I can see from your screenshot that:
- ✅ `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable is successfully added to Vercel
- ✅ Shows "Added 4m ago" - so it's definitely there
- ✅ Set for "All Environments" - perfect!

## 🚀 **Next Step: Redeploy the Application**

Now you need to redeploy so the application picks up the new environment variable:

### **Step 1: Go to Deployments Tab**
1. Click the **"Deployments"** tab at the top of your Vercel dashboard
2. You should see a list of your recent deployments

### **Step 2: Redeploy Latest Deployment**
1. Find the **most recent deployment** (should be at the top)
2. Click the **⋯** (three dots) menu button next to it
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. **Wait for the deployment to complete** (you'll see a green checkmark when done)

### **Step 3: Test the Dashboard**
After redeployment completes:
1. Visit: https://rca-agent1-983c06yd9-ritwik-vats-projects.vercel.app/demo-dashboard.html
2. Click **"🎫 Create Ticket"**
3. You should now see: `✅ Created real Linear ticket RIT-X` instead of the mock ticket

## 🎯 **Expected Result After Redeploy**

### **Before (Current):**
```
❌ Error creating Linear ticket: HTTP 500:
❌ Falling back to mock ticket creation...
```

### **After (Expected):**
```
✅ Real Linear Ticket Creation started for TCK-1001...
✅ Created real Linear ticket RIT-8
```

## ⏱️ **Timeline**
- **Redeploy:** Usually takes 1-2 minutes
- **Test:** Immediately after deployment completes
- **Cache:** May need to hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) if you still see old results

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working After Redeploy**

1. **Hard refresh** the dashboard (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try incognito window** to avoid cache issues
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vercel to propagate changes
4. **Check deployment logs** for any errors

**You're almost there! The environment variable is set correctly - just need to redeploy.** 🎯
